\begin{abstract}
Following the title, the abstract is the \textbf{second} most frequently read part of a scientific paper.
It informs about the general content and determines the paper's relevance for the reader.
It is good practice to write the abstract when writing the paper is \textbf{finished} in a way that it condenses and summarizes the content of the paper.
Only start writing the abstract when all required research and work has been finished.
Make the abstract one paragraph without reference and use about \numrange{200}{500} words.
Be sure to only draw conclusions and make only statements that are included in the paper.
Keep the text of the abstract in present tense.
A good approach to drafting an abstract is to start by summarizing  each section of the paper in \numrange{1}{2} sentences.

\section{Introduction}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the last century mankind has made unprecedented technological advances and discoveries. Naturally, Space exploration, which has fascinated all civilizations that have existed, also had a breakthrough in the previous century when USA launched Apollo 11 on 26th July 1969 to Moon. While this project was mainly targeted to explore the lunar surface. Since then many other such objects are sent in space but only to perform specific tasks like communication, observation and scientific research. These objects usually orbit around Earth and are called Satellite. 
Currently, there are 7,560 satellites orbiting Earth \cite{ucs}. But keeping these satellites operational require constant maintainance since they are exposed to extreme temperatures, radiation and micro-meteoroids. Unfortunately, not all satellites stay operational through out their mission and gracefully leave the orbit. Some gets destroyed during deployment, or lose contact and control from Earth due to communication issues. These dead satellites and other small objects created due to some form of damage to existing satellites are collectively called "Space Debris". 
There are currently 32,750 cataloged and tracked debris objects, these 50 cm or more in size and traveling at a speed of 3 km/s \cite{space_junk}. \\

These objects also travel with a random trajectory and are not predictable. Collision with this debris can be fatal for not only existing operational satellites but also for future deployments. To this end, ClearSpace SA, a Swiss startup, is developing a device resembling a four-armed "space claw" that would grip junk satellites and de-orbit them. The project is expected to go live in late 2029, and intends to de-orbit a special kind of space debris called VESPA (Vega Secondary Payload Adapter) \cite{clear_space}. 

Recently, Gecko materials have shown promise in catching space debris [link]. Gecko materials exhibits certain properties which are desirable in space debris collection, such as: Gecko materials only require smooth surfaces. Gecko Materials do not require adhesive substance and work purely through fundamental property of materials called Van Der Waals forces. Due to these properties Gecko materials offer multiple docking opportunities to any space debris and offer good re-usability.

Given promising results from early proof of concept studies on Gecko materials for space debris collection, further research on how gecko materials behave in space-like conditions such as a combination of extreme temperatures, radiation, vaccume and microgravity is needed. 

In this regard, TU Berlin and Julius-Maximilian-Universität Würzburg as part of the \textbf{gEICko: GEcko based Innovative Capture Kit for uncooperative and unprepared Orbital assets} has initiated a joint investigation of Gecko materials. The team from TU Berlin has developed a Testbed. The goal of this Testbed is to compare different kinds of gecko materials against each other. The testbed is also suitable for simulated space-like environments since it is robust and vacuum sealed, a more detailed description of TestBed is provided in the following section.

This project, in particular, is concerned with developing a firmware to control the testbed and provide researchers with an intuitive but exhaustive user interface (UI) to be able to command and control this testbed.

\subsection{The Gecko Testbed}

\begin{figure}[h]

    \includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{pics/gecko_testbed.png}
    \caption{Testbed to test Gecko materials.}
    \label{fig: gecko testbed}
\end{figure}

Figure 1 shows an image of the testbed developed by the engineers from TU Berlin. This consists of 3 stepper motors. Each motor is responsible for movement in each direction i.e. x, y and z axes. In this center of the testbed is a smooth glass surface which simulates a smooth surface from that of a space debris and also serves as a rendezvous point aka point of contact. The small green piece directly on top of this surface represents the Gecko material being tested. The vertical motors (z-axis) moves the Gecko material up and down along its axis and press it against the smooth surface such that the gecko material stick to it.

There is also a small 3 dimensional force sensor right underneath the smooth surface which can sense press/pull forces as well as shear and translatory forces. 

The following are the exact specifications and details of each component of the Testbed:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Stepper Motor: 3 stepper motors are used in this testbed. Each stepper motor is controlled using CL57T driver.
    \item Force Sensor: We have used a Strain Guage Force Sensor by ME Systeme model K3D40 (10N). We have further used GSV-4USB amplifier to control force sensor and also to serialize the output.
    \item Power Supply: We have used a generic powersupply easily available in all labs at 24V and 1.5A.
    \item Computing Unit: We have used a Raspberry Pi micro-controller as our main computing device.
\end{itemize}

All of the components of the testbed mentioned above are shown in figure 2.

    \caption{Individual Components of Gecko Testbed.}
    \label{fig: gecko testbed components}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Uses Cases of Testbed}
The main purpose for this testbed is to test and compare different gecko materials in space-like environments. The metric used to measure the effectiveness of a gecko material is the ratio between push and pull force generated, then an ideal Gecko material candidate would be one which requires minimum push forces against a smooth surface, sticks to it and then can pull the stuck surface with a much higher pull force.

This testbed accomplish this by pressing the gecko material against the smooth the surface until a target push force is reached (establishing docking), and then pull away the gecko material and measuring the pull force generated by gecko material. This simple experiment can have two further possibilities: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Case 1: When smooth surface is static and only gecko material moves up and down.
    \item Case 2: When smooth surface is static until point of contact (docking), and while gecko material start pulling the smooth surface also moves along one or both horizontal axes (X and Y).
    \item Case 3: When the gecko materials establishes contact while smooth surface is moving along horizontal axes. Similarly, pull force is also measured with gecko and smooth surface moving. This case is the most complicated out of all above and accurately simulates the behavior of uncontrolled space debris.
\end{itemize}

Now that the use cases of the testbed are laid out, in the later sections we will describe how the developed firmware handles these situations.
